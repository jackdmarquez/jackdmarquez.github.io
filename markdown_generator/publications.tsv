2016	IoT in education: Integration of objects with virtual academic communities	New advances in information systems and technologies	The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new concept that allows objects to be connected to Internet. This connectivity allows the emergence of new forms of interaction between objects and people. In educational environments the IoT could be applied to improve teaching and learning experiences. This paper proposes a new architecture for integrating objects available in educational environments with virtual academic communities (VAC). This new architecture is based on the paradigm of layered architectures and architectural styles such as REST. The proposed architecture consists of four layers: hardware/communications, messaging, services, and application. Test of the proposed architecture were made through the implementation of a case study, which was focused on practical classes of a typical digital electronics course.

2019	Heterogeneity-aware data placement in Hybrid Clouds	International Conference on Cloud Computing	In next-generation cloud computing clusters, performance of data-intensive applications will be limited, among other factors, by disks data transfer rates. In order to mitigate performance impacts, cloud systems offering hierarchical storage architectures are becoming commonplace. The Hadoop File System (HDFS) offers a collection of storage policies that exploit different storage types such as RAM_DISK, SSD, HDD, and ARCHIVE. However, developing algorithms to leverage heterogeneous storage through an efficient data placement has been challenging. This work presents an intelligent algorithm based on genetic programming which allow to find the optimal mapping of input datasets to storage types on a Hadoop file system.

2021	Performance comparison: Virtual machines and containers running artificial intelligence applications	International Conference on Information Technology & Systems	With the continuous growth of data that can be valuable for companies and scientific research, cloud computing has shown itself as one of the emerging technologies that can help solve many of these applications that need the right level of computing and ubiquitous access to them. Cloud Computing has a base technology that is virtualization, which has evolved to provide users with features from which they can benefit. There are different types of virtualization and each of them has its own way of carrying out some processes and of managing computational resources. In this paper, we present the comparison of performance between virtual machines and containers, specifically between an instance of OpenStack and docker and singularity containers. The application used to measure performance is a real application of artificial intelligence. We present the obtained results and discuss them.	Marquez J.D., Castillo M.

2021	An Intelligent Approach to Resource Allocation on Heterogeneous Cloud Infrastructures	Applied Sciences	Cloud computing systems are rapidly evolving toward multicloud architectures supported on heterogeneous hardware. Cloud service providers are widely offering different types of storage infrastructures and multi-NUMA architecture servers. Existing cloud resource allocation solutions do not comprehensively consider this heterogeneous infrastructure. In this study, we present a novel approach comprised of a hierarchical framework based on genetic programming to solve problems related to data placement and virtual machine allocation for analytics applications running on heterogeneous hardware with a variety of storage types and nonuniform memory access. Our approach optimizes data placement using the Hadoop File System on heterogeneous storage devices on multicloud systems. It guarantees the efficient allocation of virtual machines on physical machines with multiple NUMA (nonuniform memory access) domains by minimizing contention between workloads. We prove that our solutions for data placement and virtual machine allocation outperform other state-of-the-art approaches.	Marquez, J.; Mondragon, O.H.; Gonzalez, J.D.

2022	Computational and Communication Infrastructure Challenges for Resilient Cloud Services	Computers	Fault tolerance and the availability of applications, computing infrastructure, and communications systems during unexpected events are critical in cloud environments. The microservices architecture, and the technologies that it uses, should be able to maintain acceptable service levels in the face of adverse circumstances. In this paper, we discuss the challenges faced by cloud infrastructure in relation to providing resilience to applications. Based on this analysis, we present our approach for a software platform based on a microservices architecture, as well as the resilience mechanisms to mitigate the impact of infrastructure failures on the availability of applications. We demonstrate the capacity of our platform to provide resilience to analytics applications, minimizing service interruptions and keeping acceptable response times	Martinez, H. F., Mondragon, O.
