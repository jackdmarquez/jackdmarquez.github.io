excerpt: 'With the continuous growth of data that can be valuable for companies and scientific research, cloud computing has shown itself as one of the emerging technologies that can help solve many of these applications that need the right level of computing and ubiquitous access to them. Cloud Computing has a base technology that is virtualization, which has evolved to provide users with features from which they can benefit. There are different types of virtualization and each of them has its own way of carrying out some processes and of managing computational resources. In this paper, we present the comparison of performance between virtual machines and containers, specifically between an instance of OpenStack and docker and singularity containers. The application used to measure performance is a real application of artificial intelligence. We present the obtained results and discuss them.'

With the continuous growth of data that can be valuable for companies and scientific research, cloud computing has shown itself as one of the emerging technologies that can help solve many of these applications that need the right level of computing and ubiquitous access to them. Cloud Computing has a base technology that is virtualization, which has evolved to provide users with features from which they can benefit. There are different types of virtualization and each of them has its own way of carrying out some processes and of managing computational resources. In this paper, we present the comparison of performance between virtual machines and containers, specifically between an instance of OpenStack and docker and singularity containers. The application used to measure performance is a real application of artificial intelligence. We present the obtained results and discuss them.
